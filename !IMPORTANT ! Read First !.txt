Dont forget the right Custom Class:
v1: http://zzukbot.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=12
v2: http://zzukbot.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=61


IMPORTANT:
I recommend to use Bot Version 1.
The 2.0 Build is currently beta and can make mesh/waypoint errors.
Make sure you disabled " Roam From Waypoint" and " Waypoint Modifier " which can cause navigation issues.
You can find it under Settings -> Distances / Others .


All Profiles working perfect with v1 if you want to use v2 use it on your own risk.
Please report every bug with v2 to the devs so we can get soon a stable release.

If you find any bug with v1 report it to me!

Have fun and enjoy my profiles !
